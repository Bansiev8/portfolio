              I am a motivated, enthusiastic graduate with a strong interest in Cybersecurity. I would like to leverage
                my knowledge in software development to drive innovation, by tackling challenge and complex
                problems. My foundations in Cybersecurity, networking and emerging technologies will allow me to be
                successful in range of roles. My curiosity leads me to explore the latest industry trends such as machine
                learning, AI and Cloud computing and security. I enjoy working as part of a collaborative team as this
                helps me to enhance my skills and consult with colleagues and contribute to the success of any
                organisation.
